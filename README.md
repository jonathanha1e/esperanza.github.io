# Immigration Flow Tool ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½

This is a bilingual web-based tool to help users understand their immigration status and possible next steps. Designed with accessibility and simplicity in mind. Built using HTML, JavaScript, and JSON.

## Features

- Simple "yes/no/not sure" decision flow
- Bilingual interface (EspaÃ±ol / English)
- Court date calculator with deadlines
- Text-to-speech for accessibility
- Logic powered by an external `flow.json` file

## Project Structure
immigration-flow/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Main interface
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js         # Logic and interactivity (maybe a future thing)
â”œâ”€â”€ flow.json         # Decision tree content (editable)
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css         # (Optional) External styles
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # Project info

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Walk through the flow by answering questions.

## Future Plans

- Add more branches for different immigration scenarios (i-589s, visa apps, etc.)
- Improve accessibility and mobile design
- Allow community input on flow content
- Connect to resource databases

## Why This Exists

The immigration system is insanely complex. It sucks to navigate without any help. This tool isn't meant to provide legal advice, just information so folks know where they're at in the process and links to additional resources.

## Disclaimer

This tool is for informational purposes only and **does not constitute legal advice**. Always consult with a licensed immigration attorney or accredited representative.

## Contributions

Pull requests are welcome! Help improve the flow, UI, translations, or add new branches. I don't really know how to code and am learning as I go with a lot of help from chatGPT and other programmers. My expertise is in the immigration side of things, so any coding help/UI improvements are greatly appreciated.
